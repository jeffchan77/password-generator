# password-generator
For my third repository on Github, I worked on creating a Javascript password generator. This creates a random password based on user input. The user is prompted the following:

Length of password (must be between 8 and 128 characters)

Character types they want to include (lower case, upper case, special characters, numbers)

The end result is a randomly generated password based on the criteria chosen by the user. If it does not fall within the given conditions (characters less than 8 or greater than 128) or none of the given characters being selected, the user will be looped back to the first prompt.
